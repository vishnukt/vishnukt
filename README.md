Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
I'm Vishnu, a passionate backend engineer currently at Shopdeck. I build scalable eCommerce systems and optimize order workflows, drawing on my experience in product-based startups. I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant, efficient solutions using Node.js, Python, and modern technologies.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy working on hobby projects that address real-life problems and experimenting with innovative ideas. I believe in the power of technology to make everyday tasks simpler and more effective.
